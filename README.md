# NetworkX-Topology-Shortest-Path-in-Python
The Code is the Solution to the Scenario Given in Readme.md

Scenario:
Consider 100 nodes at random positions. Get them connected in such a way that 
each node must have 5 interfaces and all these 5 interfaces are connected to 5 other nodes. Only the 
source and destination nodes have 3 interfaces. The source is at least 70 nodes away from destination. 
Assign each link a random value between 1 to 15. Calculate total number of paths from source to 
destination. Among those paths, select the optimal path by considering delay as a metric. Also, 
calculate the number of hops for each path. After finding the optimal path, now transmit five packets 
of equal size from source to destination, calculate the average delay, and the overhead of the network. 
Highlight total number of iterations and the algorithm you use to find the optimal path. Repeat the
experiment for 20 times with different random values to calculate the average and the optimal path.


Also consider these 100 nodes as mobile nodes moving with constant speed and repeat 
all the steps given in the scenario above. Consider a value between 6 to 9 m/s. Calculate the number of 
attempts a message takes to reach the destination.
